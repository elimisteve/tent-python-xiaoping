# Introduction

Xiaoping is a Python client library for [Tent](https://tent.io) v0.3. I'm writing it to get practice with the Tent protocol. Thanks to the [longears/python-tent-client](https://github.com/longears/python-tent-client) (for Tent v0.1) and [tent-client-ruby](https://github.com/tent/tent-client-ruby) for serving as references.
